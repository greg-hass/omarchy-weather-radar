// Headless singleton behind the radar plugin.
//
// A bar widget is instantiated once per monitor, so anything that polls has to
// live here instead: the shell mounts exactly one service per plugin, which
// keeps a two-monitor setup from doubling every request.
//
// Three responsibilities:
//
//   1. Own the RainViewer frame manifest, so that a two-monitor setup showing
//      the map on both shares one copy instead of fetching one each. It is 818
//      bytes, and is fetched only while the map is open. The property is
//      `radarManifest` rather than the obvious `manifest` because the shell
//      assigns the plugin's own manifest.json to any service exposing a
//      property by that name.
//
//   2. Keep the loop's radar tiles on disk, so that each is fetched once
//      rather than on every pass through the loop.
//
//   3. Decide whether to warn about approaching weather, and say so once.
//
// On (3), a note on why the alert reads a point forecast rather than the radar
// image it draws. Distance alone does not mean approaching — a cell 80 km east
// travelling east is not your problem — so a radar-echo alert would have to
// derive motion vectors across frames to avoid crying wolf. The question the
// user is actually asking is "will weather hit me, and how bad", and a point
// forecast answers exactly that, including the instability indices that
// separate ordinary rain from a severe storm. Radar remains the better picture;
// the forecast is the better trigger.

  // that never opens the map never pays for it.

  // Data ships with the plugin instead of arriving as tiles. The world's

  // than a property — the one this plugin used began stamping "API KEY

  // anything able to replace it can replace Service.qml beside it, so a
  // ceiling here would guard nothing. Corruption is handled instead — the
  // decoder answers null on anything it cannot read, including a truncated
  // file.
  //
  // Decoding is spread over many short steps rather than done in one call,
  // because this is the thread that draws the bar, every panel and the lock
  // screen, and one call holds it for over half a second on a fast machine
  // and for seconds on a slow one. Each layer is published as it completes,
